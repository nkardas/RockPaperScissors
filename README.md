# RockPaperScissors: Brain Training Game

## Overview
RockPaperScissors is a brain training game built with SwiftUI that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors. The game combines elements of logic and chance, providing an engaging way to practice decision-making skills.

## Features
- **Random Move Selection**: Each turn, the app randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors.
- **Win/Lose Prompt**: The app alternates between prompting the player to win or lose each round.
- **Player Interaction**: Players choose their move by tapping one of three buttons: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- **Scoring System**: Players earn points for correct moves and lose points for incorrect ones.
- **Game Rounds**: The game consists of 10 rounds, after which the player's score is displayed.

## Technologies Used
- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface.
- **State Management**: Using `@State` properties to track the app's current choice and win/lose condition.
- **Randomization**: Utilizing `Int.random(in:)` and `Bool.random()` for random move selection and win/lose prompts.

## What I Learned
This project reinforced my understanding of:
- Combining arrays, state management, and user interactions in SwiftUI.
- Implementing randomization to create dynamic gameplay experiences.
- Designing intuitive user interfaces with buttons and text views.
- Using logic to determine game outcomes based on player choices.

By completing this challenge, I gained practical experience in integrating Swift and SwiftUI concepts to build an interactive game.

## Conclusion
RockPaperScissors is a fun and educational project that enhances both programming skills and logical thinking. It demonstrates how to create an engaging game using simple SwiftUI components and logic.
